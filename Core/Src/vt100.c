/*
 * vt100.c
 *
 * This module provides a thin wrapper around the VT100 parser
 * implemented in gdi_vt100.c.  It exposes the same API as the
 * original vt100.c from the featureâ€‘vt100 branch (vt100_init(),
 * vt100_feed() and vt100_process_buffer()) but delegates all
 * parsing work to the gdiVT100Feed() and gdiVT100ProcessBuffer()
 * functions.  This approach avoids duplication between two
 * different VT100 parsers and ensures that only one implementation
 * is maintained.
